## What Quantum is

Quantum is a research program for a private note-based DAG protocol. A
releasable design must satisfy five requirements together:

- **post-quantum security:** at least 128 bits of composed post-quantum security
  across every security-critical layer, without classical fallbacks;
- **privacy and network anonymity by default:** no transparent transfer mode,
  with sender, recipient, amount, graph relationship, and origin metadata
  protected within a published threat model;
- **scalability:** at least 1,000 accepted layer-1 transactions per second in a
  reproducible end-to-end test with all privacy and validation work enabled;
- **independent operability and recovery:** executing validation, restart,
  pruning, bootstrap, and recovery remain inside a frozen, independently
  obtainable resource profile without a trusted sole provider;
- **contestable production and reviewed long-run security funding:** pooled
  miners can construct their own templates, ordering/censorship incentives pass
  explicit gates, and the exact monetary policy has independently reviewed
  accounting and economic evidence.

These are release requirements, not achieved capabilities.

The initial product boundary is a private post-quantum cash and settlement
layer for people, organisations, and autonomous software agents. It targets
native-QTM transfers, user-controlled selective disclosure, and a finite set of
proof-bounded payment policies—not a general-purpose smart-contract platform.
Private assets, bridges, and cross-chain execution require later, separately
reviewed profiles and do not inherit the base protocol's claims.

## Current status

**Research design 0.5.4-research — not implementation-ready or production-safe.**

This repository currently contains a static documentation website, a research
design, a verification plan, and a transaction-feasibility pre-registration
draft. It does not contain a node, wallet, blockchain
implementation, testnet, external security audit, or completed performance
benchmark.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| SHAKE256 and ML-KEM-1024 | Standards selected; integration not verified |
| Spend authorization | FIPS 205 SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256f incumbent and required 256s comparator; comparative gate open |
| Lattice commitment | Blocking research gate |
| STARK validity proof | Blocking research gate |
| Complete 2-input/2-output transaction proof | Experiment specified; implementation and result absent |
| Receiving, offline catch-up and transport costs | Early T006 screen specified before T305; not run |
| GHOSTDAG and private state ordering | Blocking research gate |
| Validator operability | Blocking research gate; no numeric profile frozen |
| Current data, snapshots, and recovery | Blocking research gate |
| Miner templates, pools, and ordering incentives | Blocking research gate |
| PoW hardware contestability | Comparative research gate; algorithm not selected |
| Post-quantum upgrade governance | Blocking research gate; authorisation and activation mechanism not selected |
| Monetary security | Current 21M lifetime issuance cap retained; bounded dynamic-fee/reward-window comparator drafted; T506/G13 not run |
| Network anonymity | Blocking research gate |
| ≥1,000 accepted L1 TPS | Acceptance target; not yet benchmarked |

The project must stop before production if any of the five core requirements
cannot be demonstrated.

## Research-paper programme

Four separate manuscripts are planned because the problems have different
adversaries, evidence, and stop/go decisions:

| Order | Research question | Status |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Does full in-proof FIPS 205 SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256f or 256s provide a material benefit over one-time/stateful hash-based baselines while the same complete 2-input/2-output relation meets frozen security and client budgets? | Active comparative research protocol 0.4.0; no result |
| 2 | Can wallets discover post-quantum encrypted notes privately at the measured output rate? | [Template](papers/zkprivacy/templates/private-note-discovery-template.md) |
| 3 | Can transaction origins remain hidden under a named observer model at BlockDAG throughput? | [Template](papers/zkprivacy/templates/network-origin-anonymity-template.md) |
| 4 | Can GHOSTDAG apply private commitments, nullifiers, anchors, rewards, and reorganisations deterministically? | [Template](papers/zkprivacy/templates/ghostdag-private-state-template.md) |

The programme does not claim that these broad areas are new. TzEL already
publishes an experimental note/nullifier/ML-KEM/one-time-authorisation/STARK
payment path, while Lattice RingCT, MatRiCT/MatRiCT+, LACT+, private payment
detection and retrieval, cryptocurrency network-origin anonymity, and
GHOSTDAG cover further major subproblems. Paper 1 is therefore a comparative
feasibility and standardisation study, not a new private-payment-protocol
claim. The
[versioned prior-art decision](papers/zkprivacy/decisions/t305-prior-art-decision.md)
records the adopt/adapt/replicate boundary. Each later manuscript must likewise
state and independently review its narrower contribution. The
[template index](papers/zkprivacy/templates/README.md) defines when a template
may become an active paper.

## Candidate protocol directions

| Responsibility | Candidate direction | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Hash/XOF | SHAKE256, NIST FIPS 202 | Standard selected |
| Authorization | Stateless incumbent: SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256f; required 256s comparator; stateful comparators: independently specified one-time tree and applicable NIST SP 800-208 profile | Same-relation cost, state-failure model, and separate material-benefit decisions open |
| Key encapsulation | ML-KEM-1024, NIST FIPS 203 | Authenticated composition open |
| Validity proof | Transparent STARK | Exact AIR/FRI/ZK profile open |
| Note commitment | Reviewed lattice construction | Construction and parameters open |
| Consensus | Versioned GHOSTDAG-based PoW profile | State ordering, DAA and finality open |
| Origin privacy | Dedicated anonymous transport layer | Protocol and analysis open |
| Validator operability | Versioned profile frozen before result interpretation | Exact ceilings and G7/G10 evidence open |
| State validity/bootstrap | Authenticated checkpoint/replay; accumulated proof only if T306 selects it | Validity, current data, wallet witnesses, and recovery remain separate |
| Current data/recovery | Complete current data for executing validators plus authenticated multi-provider recovery | Encoding, reconstruction, repair, retention, withholding, and eclipse gates open |
| Block templates | Miner-controlled Template Provider/Job Declarator | Pool protocol, private payouts, adoption and overhead gate open |
| Ordering/incentives | Candidate comparison under the exact public fields and DAG rules | No MEV-free claim; fee, conflict, timing, censorship and reorg gate open |
| Monetary policy | Current 21M lifetime gross-issuance cap with bounded dynamic-fee/reward-window comparator | Exact controller parameters, allocation, schedule and long-run security evidence open |
| PoW hardware | Candidate selected only after contestability study | No ASIC-resistance claim; algorithm open |
| Upgrade governance | Versioned post-quantum authorisation and deterministic activation | T510 mechanism, key lifecycle, compromise recovery, and emergency path open |
| Selective disclosure | Incoming, full-wallet, transaction, and auditor-scoped capabilities | Construction and scope proofs open |
| Payment logic | Finite registry of bounded private payment policies | Post-core profile; no general VM |

Selecting a standardized primitive does not prove the security, anonymity, or
performance of the composed protocol.

## Local documentation site

The checked-in website can be opened directly from a standalone clone without
starting a runtime:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/des1re10/Quantum.git
cd Quantum
# Open index.html in a browser
~~~

The public interface supports English and German through the header language
switcher. The selected language is preserved in local navigation through the
<code>?lang=en</code> or <code>?lang=de</code> query parameter; no server
runtime or external translation service is required. The company footer follows
the shared Phexora AI footer contract, while privacy, terms, imprint, and refund
policy remain at their canonical <code>phexora.ai</code> destinations.

The validated HTTP preview is a development-workspace command. From a complete
<code>VisualStudio</code> workspace containing the sibling
<code>Libraries</code> repository, run:

~~~bash
cd Quantum
./start-local.sh
# Open http://127.0.0.1:9180
~~~

On Windows, use <code>start-local.bat</code>. When no port is supplied, both
launchers resolve it through the shared application registry; the Windows
launcher additionally uses the shared startup helper. Required workspace
dependencies fail closed, selected ports are validated, and both servers bind
to <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The launchers also verify that generated paper PDFs
are current; rebuilding them requires the sibling <code>DocWizard-Pro</code>
repository.

## PDF generation

Root-level Markdown files in <code>papers/zkprivacy/</code> are the
authoritative active-paper sources. Same-name PDF files are generated through
the adjacent DocWizard-Pro repository:

~~~bash
./build-pdfs.sh
# On Windows: build-pdfs.bat
~~~

All active-paper PDFs must be regenerated after material paper changes.
Planning files under <code>papers/zkprivacy/templates/</code> and decision
records under <code>papers/zkprivacy/decisions/</code> are deliberately
excluded from the PDF build and are not presented as completed papers.

The papers select DocWizard's `scientific` style in their front matter. Their
section titles already contain normative numbers, so the build deliberately
does not add DocWizard's automatic section numbering.

The build scripts use the adjacent DocWizard-Pro repository's prepared
`.venv` runtime and fail if that exact runtime, Pandoc, or XeLaTeX is missing.

## Contributing

Useful contributions include:

- corrections to the threat model or validity relation;
- concrete, cited commitment or STARK analyses;
- reproducible complete-transaction proving and aggregation benchmarks;
- deterministic GHOSTDAG/state-ordering models;
- anonymous-network threat analysis;
- independent implementations and interoperability vectors;
- reproducible performance and storage budgets.

Do not describe an open gate as verified. Cryptographic, consensus, anonymity,
and release approvals require independent human specialist review.
